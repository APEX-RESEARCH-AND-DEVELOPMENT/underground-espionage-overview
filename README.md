# Underground Espionage Overview

There are various number of underground Israeli groups present on platforms like Telegram, Signal etc. 

These groups tend to talk really badly upon Palestinians as well as people in general who are against Zionism and Judaism.

They have a genuine disgust for Palestinian people out of no reason whatsoever, and also say the most incriminating things possible that is surely to backfire if ever said in public. That being said, they sometimes also leak critical pieces of information such as anything privately related to military operations.


## What this project does
Essentially, this project takes advantage of the public nature of those groups, by infiltrating them (basically joining them with dummy accounts) and dumping all the data in those groups since they can be very incriminating against Israelis themselves as well as affiliated Jewish people

The dumped data can then be displayed publicly for everyone to witness and see, and be processed in order to find crucial information that can help the case of genocide happening in Palestine.

## Volunteer Requirements
- Moderate experience in any of the following languages
    - Python, TypeScript JSX/React, Rust
- Ability to vet and find underground Israeli groups
- Familiarity with version control tools
    - Git, GitHub

## Current Progress
A demo website is available: https://apex-informer.vercel.app

And as of now, a Rust-based executable used to dump messages concurrently from Telegram is being developed, and an alpha version is available for volunteers to test.

Please reach out to Nash [@cursedmonolith (Discord)] [@@fencehopper_1982 (Telegram)] to get your hands on the program to try it out.
